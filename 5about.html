<center> <h2>"Packages of Hope. Buy a box, Give a box."</h2> </center>
<center> <p id="abouttext"> ABOX is a non-profit organization created by five high school students to help those struggling from the effects of COVID-19. Every ABOX bought is hand-packed and shipped for 20$. Products included in the ABOX are sourced from small or local businesses to help support businesses affected by COVID-19. For every ABOX bought, one will be gifted to a homeless shelter or people in need. All leftover proceeds will be donated to the CDC Foundation and the International Rescue Committee. </p> </center>

<h2 class="learnheader"> Our Inspiration </h2>
<p id="inspiration"> After viewing news stories shown on social media about how South Korea’s public health officials are giving out boxes to help their citizens survive a minimum of two weeks in quarantine. These boxes contained essential items such as hand sanitizer, toothbrushes, thermometers, and masks. The team of “ABOX” loved this concept and hopes to bring this similar product to the United States and Canada with our non-profit company. </p>
